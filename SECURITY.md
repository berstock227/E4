## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to prevent potential exploitation.

### 2. **Email us directly**
Send a detailed report to: `security@vue3project2025.com`

### 3. **Include the following information**
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix**: If you have a solution in mind
- **Environment**: OS, browser, Node.js version
- **Proof of concept**: If applicable

### 4. **Response timeline**
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix timeline**: Depends on severity (1-30 days)

## Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Token refresh mechanism
- Secure password hashing
- Session management

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection
- File upload validation

### API Security
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- Request size limits
- CORS configuration
- Secure headers
- Error handling without information disclosure

### Data Protection
- HTTPS enforcement
- Secure cookie settings
- Data encryption at rest
- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Keep dependencies updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Use environment variables**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use `.env` files for local development
   - Use secure secret management in production

3. **Validate all inputs**
   - Client-side validation for UX
   - Server-side validation for security
   - Sanitize data before processing

4. **Follow secure coding practices**
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Escape output data
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use HTTPS in production

### For Users
1. **Keep your system updated**
   - Update Node.js regularly
   - Update dependencies
   - Use latest browser versions

2. **Use strong passwords**
   - Minimum 8 characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
   - Unique passwords for different services

3. **Enable 2FA when available**
   - Use authenticator apps
   - Keep backup codes secure

4. **Be cautious with file uploads**
   - Only upload necessary files
   - Verify file types and sizes
   - Scan for malware
